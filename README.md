Introduction

Programming Concepts is a repository that houses programs designed to illustrate and explain various programming concepts in C, C++, and Java. The programs are organized by concept, making it easy for learners and developers to explore and understand the nuances of each topic.

Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. Education : Provide a resource for individuals to learn and reinforce programming concepts through practical examples.

2. Diversity: Cover a wide range of programming concepts, from basic to advanced, catering to learners with varying levels of expertise.

3. Community: Foster a collaborative environment where contributors can share their knowledge and contribute to the growth of the repository.



The repository is organized into folders corresponding to different programming concepts. Each concept folder contains implementations in C, C++, and Java. Here are some of the key programming concepts covered:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Functions and Procedures
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures (Arrays)
- Algorithms
- Error Handling
- File I/O
- ... and more!

Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the code to enhance your understanding of each concept.


Happy coding!
